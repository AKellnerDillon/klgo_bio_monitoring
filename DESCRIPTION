Title: Assessment of the Coastal Waterbird Monitoring Program at Klondike Goldrush NHP
Description: This research compendium contains an assessment of the Klondike Goldrush National Historical Park's 
"Coastal Waterbird Survey", a program staff have conducted since 2003 for monitoring coastal waterbird species 
distribution and abundance multiple times each year from late April through late September.  The assessment 
addressed four broad topics following the major Phases of a monitoring program (Reynolds et al. 2016): 
(i) why - [Problem Framing & Information Objectives] Are the management objective(s) motivating the monitoring 
well articulated? Do they remain relevant and important?
(ii) how - [Data Collection Design] Does the monitoring data collection design effectively addresses the 
information objectives? Given interim learning regarding system characteristics and improvements in measurement 
technologies, are the information goals (including accuracy and precision goals), actually feasible? If so, can 
the data collection be made more efficient, reducing the observation burden on staff resources?  
(iii) how - [Data Analysis Design] Do the data analysis methods effectively address the information objectives?
Are more informative analyses available given interim improvements in methods? 
(iv) how - [Workflows & Reporting] Are workflows and related software systems in place to allow timely, and efficient, 
data management, analysis updating, reporting, and distribution of findings to target audiences of information users?  
The assessment addressed all four topics but focused predominantly on topics (i), (ii), and (iii), with
suggested follow on analyses to consider addressing under topic (iv).
