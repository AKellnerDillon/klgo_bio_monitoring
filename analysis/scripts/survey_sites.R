# Note to Madeleine, 2019 March 24
# It is better to just select out, and reformat where necessary, the subsets you want from the 
# data object created in data_wrangling.R. Then you wouldn't have to re-filter by year, mutate date, etc.
###
# E.g., a good programming goal is minimize the number of new objects and ensure always pulling from 
# the single source object so that anytime there is new data we only have to recreate that main source object
# and we know all the other scripts will be updated appropriately.
# That will also help so that when the Database is fixed (which I think may actually have happened), we
# only need to update that one script for data ingesting & the rest doesn't need changed.
