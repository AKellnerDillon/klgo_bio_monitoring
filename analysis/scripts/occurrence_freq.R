#MADELEINE: add a graphic of spp frequency of occurrence 
#(maybe some panel-rich figure, one panel per spp, 
#showing annual average percentage of daily observations 
#in which spp was sighted - as line-connected points?- 
#ordered from most frequently observed spp to least frequently. 
#(e.g., use facets). x axis is Day of Season, 
#y axis is % as decimal [0, 1.0], curves for each year; 
#facet by species. LET'S DISCUSS - 
#Think about appropriate estimator so annual value accounts 
#for variation in survey effort across years.) 
#likely needs to be a full page figure (e.g., 
#weâ€™ll need to set fig.width and fig.height).

occurrence_data <- target_data %>%
  group_by(Year) #%>%
  #mutate()

#second graph shows observations each year relative to other species
#percent_obs will be the percent of observations each date that 
#the spp composed
occurrence_species <- target_data %>%
  group_by(Year, YearDay) %>%
  #find all observations of all species on certain date
  mutate(all_obs = sum(obs_date)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  #find percent of observations accreditable to each species
  group_by(Species, Year, YearDay) %>%
  mutate(percent_obs = obs_date/all_obs) #%>%
  #filter(Species == "HERG")

ggplot(occurrence_species, aes(Year, percent_obs)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = Year)) +
  #for now, limit set at 50% - how to account for variability?
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, .50)) +
  facet_wrap(~Species)
