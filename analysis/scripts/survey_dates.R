# of WHEN, each year, the surveys actually started. E.g., so the viewer can
# separate out any changes in species phenology from changes in survey timing and effort levels.
# ALSO may need to think about either dropping some spp (e.g., Am Black Duck) or otherwise
# constraining the range of the y axis so really focus on early (or late) period.
